The Customer class represents a customer of the system. The UtilityProvider class represents a utility provider that supports bill payments through the system. The Bill class represents a bill that is generated by a utility provider. The BillRetrievalService class is responsible for retrieving bills from utility providers. The NotificationService class is responsible for sending notifications to customers about their upcoming bills. The PaymentService class is responsible for processing customer payments for bills.

The arrows in the class diagram represent dependencies between the classes. For example, the BillRetrievalService class depends on the Customer class and the UtilityProvider class because it needs to know which customer's bills to retrieve and which utility provider to retrieve them from. The NotificationService class depends on the Customer class and the Bill class because it needs to know who to send the notification to and what bill to notify them about. The PaymentService class depends on the Customer class and the Bill class because it needs to know who is paying the bill and what bill is being paid.

This is just a simplified class diagram. The actual system design may be more complex, with additional classes and relationships.
